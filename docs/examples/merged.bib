@article{Ferrari:04a,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a regression model where the response is beta distributed using a parameterization of the beta law that is indexed by mean and dispersion parameters. The proposed model is useful for situations it,here the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed responses Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. Me provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fishers information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

@article{wang:12a,
	Abstract = {This paper is motivated from the analysis of neuroscience data in a study of neural and muscular mechanisms of muscle fatigue. Multidimensional outcomes of different natures were obtained simultaneously from multiple modalities, including handgrip force, electromyography (EMG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first study individual modeling of the univariate response depending on its nature. A mixed-effects beta model and a mixed-effects simplex model are compared for modeling the force/EMG percentages. A mixed-effects negative-binomial model is proposed for modeling the fMRI counts. Then, I present a joint modeling approach to model the multidimensional outcomes together, which allows us to not only estimate the covariate effects but also to evaluate the strength of association among the multiple responses from different modalities. A simulation study is conducted to quantify the possible benefits by the new approaches in finite sample situations. Finally, the analysis of the fatigue data is illustrated with the use of the proposed methods.},

@article{Muff:15a,
	Abstract = {To account for measurement error (ME) in explanatory variables, Bayesian approaches provide a flexible framework, as expert knowledge can be incorporated in the prior distributions. Recently, integrated nested Laplace approximations have been proven to be a computationally convenient alternative to sampling approaches for Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models. We show how the most common approaches to adjust for ME, the classical and the Berkson ME, fit into this framework. This is achieved through a reformulation with augmented pseudo-observations and a suitable extension of the latent Gaussian field. Two specific classes are described, which allow for a particularly simple implementation using integrated nested Laplace approximations. We present three applications within the framework of generalized linear (mixed) models with ME. To illustrate the practical feasibility, R code is provided in on-line supplementary material.},

	Abstract = {Use of errors-in-variables models is appropriate in many practical experimental problems. However, inference based on such models is by no means straightforward. In previous analyses, simplifying assumptions have been made in order to ease this intractability, but assumptions of this nature are unfortunate and restrictive. In this paper, we analyse errors-in-variables models in full generality under a Bayesian formulation. In order to compute the necessary posterior distributions, we utilize various computational techniques. Two specific non-linear errors-in-variables regression examples are considered; the first is a re-analysed Berkson-type model, and the second is a classical errors-in-variables model. Our analyses are compared and contrasted with those presented elsewhere in the literature.},

	Abstract = {Data from many scientific areas often come with measurement error. Density or distribution function estimation from contaminated data and nonparametric regression with errors-in-variables are two important topics in measurement error models. In this paper, we present a new software package decon for R, which contains a collection of functions that use the deconvolution kernel methods to deal with the measurement error problems. The functions allow the errors to be either homoscedastic or heteroscedastic. To make the deconvolution estimators computationally more efficient in R, we adapt the fast Fourier transform algorithm for density estimation with error-free data to the deconvolution kernel estimation. We discuss the practical selection of the smoothing parameter in deconvolution methods and illustrate the use of the package through both simulated and real examples.},

	Abstract = {We describe and analyze a longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study relating changes in the microstructure of intracranial white matter tracts to cognitive disability in multiple sclerosis patients. In this application the scalar outcome and the functional exposure are measured longitudinally. This data structure is new and raises challenges that cannot be addressed with current methods and software. To analyze the data, we introduce a penalized functional regression model and inferential tools designed specifically for these emerging types of data. Our proposed model extends the Generalized Linear Mixed Model by adding functional predictors; this method is computationally feasible and is applicable when the functional predictors are measured densely, sparsely or with error. An online appendix compares two implementations, one likelihood-based and the other Bayesian, and provides the software used in simulations; the likelihood-based implementation is included as the lpfr() function in the R package refund available on CRAN.},

	Abstract = {We develop fast fitting methods for generalized functional
		  linear models. The functional predictor is projected onto a
		  large number of smooth eigenvectors and the co-efficient
		  function is estimated using penalized spline regression;
		  confidence intervals based on the mixed model framework are
		  obtained. Our method can be applied to many functional data
		  designs including functions measured with and without
		  error, sparsely or densely sampled. The methods also extend
		  to the case of multiple functional predictors or functional
		  predictors with a natural multilevel structure. The
		  approach can be implemented using standard mixed effects
		  software and is computationally fast. The methodology is
		  motivated by a study of white-matter demyelination via
		  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The aim of this study is to
		  analyze differences between various cerebral white-matter
		  tract property measurements of multiple sclerosis (MS)
		  patients and controls. While the statistical developments
		  proposed here were motivated by the DTI study, the
		  methodology is designed and presented in generality and is
		  applicable to many other areas of scientific research. An
		  online appendix provides R implementations of all
		  simulations.},

@article{morris:06a,
	Abstract = {Increasingly, scientific studies yield functional data, in
		  which the ideal units of observation are curves and the
		  observed data consist of sets of curves that are sampled on
		  a fine grid. We present new methodology that generalizes
		  the linear mixed model to the functional mixed model
		  framework, with model fitting done by using a Bayesian
		  wavelet-based approach. This method is flexible, allowing
		  functions of arbitrary form and the full range of fixed
		  effects structures and between-curve covariance structures
		  that are available in the mixed model framework. It yields
		  nonparametric estimates of the fixed and random-effects
		  functions as well as the various between-curve and
		  within-curve covariance matrices. The functional fixed
		  effects are adaptively regularized as a result of the
		  non-linear shrinkage prior that is imposed on the fixed
		  effects' wavelet coefficients, and the random-effect
		  functions experience a form of adaptive regularization
		  because of the separately estimated variance components for
		  each wavelet coefficient. Because we have posterior samples
		  for all model quantities, we can perform pointwise or joint
		  Bayesian inference or prediction on the quantities of the
		  model. The adaptiveness of the method makes it especially
		  appropriate for modelling irregular functional data that
		  are characterized by numerous local features like peaks.},

	Abstract = {For bivariate meta-analysis of diagnostic studies,
		  likelihood approaches are very popular. However, they often
		  run into numerical problems with possible non-convergence.
		  In addition, the construction of confidence intervals is
		  controversial. Bayesian methods based on Markov chain Monte
		  Carlo (MCMC) sampling could be used, but are often
		  difficult to implement, and require long running times and
		  diagnostic convergence checks. Recently, a new Bayesian
		  deterministic inference approach for latent Gaussian models
		  using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) has
		  been proposed. With this approach MCMC sampling becomes
		  redundant as the posterior marginal distributions are
		  directly and accurately approximated. By means of a real
		  data set we investigate the influence of the prior
		  information provided and compare the results obtained by
		  INLA, MCMC, and the maximum likelihood procedure SAS PROC
		  NLMIXED. Using a simulation study we further extend the
		  comparison of INLA and SAS PROC NLMIXED by assessing their
		  performance in terms of bias, mean-squared error, coverage
		  probability, and convergence rate. The results indicate
		  that INLA is more stable and gives generally better
		  coverage probabilities for the pooled estimates and less
		  biased estimates of variance parameters. The
		  user-friendliness of INLA is demonstrated by documented
		  R-code},

	Abstract = {Multivariate data analysis permits the study of
		  observations which are finite sets of numbers, but modern
		  data collection situations can involve data, or the
		  processes giving rise to them, which are functions.
		  Functional data analysis involves infinite dimensional
		  processes and/or data. The paper shows how the theory of
		  L-splines can support generalizations of linear modelling
		  and principal components analysis to samples drawn from
		  random functions. Spline smoothing rests on a partition of
		  a function space into two orthogonal subspaces, one of
		  which contains the obvious or structural components of
		  variation among a set of observed functions, and the other
		  of which contains residual components. This partitioning is
		  achieved through the use of a linear differential operator,
		  and we show how the theory of polynomial splines can be
		  applied more generally with an arbitrary operator and
		  associated boundary constraints. These data analysis tools
		  are illustrated by a study of variation in
		  temperature-precipitation patterns among some Canadian
		  weather-stations.},

		  methods have been developed, an extremely popular one being
		  MAXENT, a maximum entropy modeling approach. In this
		  article, we show that MAXENT is equivalent to a Poisson
		  regression model and hence is related to a Poisson point
		  process model, differing only in the intercept term, which
		  is scale-dependent in MAXENT. We illustrate a number of
		  improvements to MAXENT that follow from these relations. In
		  particular, a point process model approach facilitates
		  methods for choosing the appropriate spatial resolution,
		  assessing model adequacy, and choosing the LASSO penalty
		  parameter, all currently unavailable to MAXENT. The
		  equivalence result represents a significant step in the
