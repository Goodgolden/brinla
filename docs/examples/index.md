You will need to [install the brinla R package](https://github.com/julianfaraway/brinla) to run the examples described here.

These examples do not correspond exactly with found in the [book](../index.md). Some come from earlier drafts,
some are not found in the book and some are experimental. 

# Worked Examples

- [Introduction](intro.md) - a simple example concerning Hubble's law.
- [Linear regression](chicago.md) - Multiple regression example using some Chicago Insurance data
- [One-way ANOVA](reeds.md) - just one random effect
- [Ridge regression](ridge.md) - Ridge regression with meat spectroscopy data
- [Gaussian Process regression](gpreg.md) - GP regression on fossil data
- [Confidence bands for smoothness](smoothband.md) - GP regression to determine uncertainty regarding smoothness
- [Non-stationary smoothing](nonstat.md) - GP regression with variable smoothing
- [Generalized Extreme Values](gev.md) - fitting maximum annual river flows
- [Define your own prior](prior.md) - using a half Cauchy prior for the SD of a random effect.
- [Linear regression with bounded parameters](frenchpres.md) - French presidential election example with slope parameters bounded in [0,1]
